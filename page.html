    <p>Gyeongbok Palace, located in the heart of Seoul, South Korea, is one of the most iconic and historically significant landmarks in the country. Built in 1395 during the Joseon Dynasty, it served as the main royal palace for centuries. The name "Gyeongbok" means "greatly blessed by heaven," reflecting its importance as a symbol of royal authority and national pride. The palace complex features stunning traditional Korean architecture, beautiful gardens, and historical halls such as Geunjeongjeon (the throne hall). Today, Gyeongbok Palace is a popular tourist destination where visitors can explore Koreaâ€™s royal history and even watch the changing of the guard ceremony in traditional attire.
